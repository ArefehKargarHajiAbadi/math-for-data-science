# Statistics & Probability: Course Overview

This repository presents a structured, step-by-step journey through the core concepts of **Statistics and Probability**, mirroring the content of the included Jupyter Notebooks. It's designed to provide the mathematical foundation necessary for advanced fields like data science, machine learning, and quantitative analysis.

## Core Topics Covered

* **Foundations:** The course begins with the **basics of probability** and **descriptive statistics**, setting the stage for more complex analysis.
* **Random Variables & Distributions:** You'll gain a deep understanding of both **discrete and continuous random variables** and their associated **probability distributions** (covered extensively in modules 2, 3, and 4).
* **Data Characteristics (Moments):** Detailed modules cover how to compute and interpret **moments** (e.g., mean, variance, skewness) to characterize the shape and spread of data (Module 5).
* **Multivariate Analysis:** The curriculum progresses to handling **multiple random variables**, exploring concepts like **joint distributions**, **correlation coefficients**, and **random vectors** (Modules 6, 7, and 8).
* **Advanced Concepts (Information Theory):** The final modules introduce the fundamental ideas of **Information Theory**, including **entropy** and **mutual information**, providing critical context for data compression and machine learning model evaluation (Modules 9 and 10).
